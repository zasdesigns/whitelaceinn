Crisp linen fabrics in sunny yellow florals on sky blue backgrounds, cover the sofa and chairs that wait invitingly in front of the "wall of windows" that face the Innâ€™s flower gardens. Your own back porch and patio overlook the gardens. The Country Empire tall post bed with a canopy is "dressed" in blue and yellow. The bed, sitting area and whirlpool all view the beautiful fireplace mantel, that was locally crafted out of butternut and cherry.
