### Suite 18

##### Fall Festival:
Timeless and romantic - an overstuffed sofa piled high with pillows, French toile wallpaper in natural tones, and Ralph Lauren fabrics in shades of mellow green and rose. The exceptional bed is a mahogany plantation canopy four post. Wherever you relax you view a fireplace, including the whirlpool thatâ€™s beneath a corner of windows in the bathroom. View the stars from a little balcony off the bathroom.
