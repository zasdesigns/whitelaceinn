A refined atmosphere is created combining antique oriental carpets in warm shades of blue and red, with pastel floral Ralph Lauren fabrics on a winter white back-ground. In the bedroom, a handsome pencil post bed in glowing tiger maple views the corner fireplace. The comfy sofa in the sitting room faces an entertainment center and the two-sided fireplace. The whirlpool in the bathroom also views the fireplace.
