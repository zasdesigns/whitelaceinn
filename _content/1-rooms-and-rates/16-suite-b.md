Welcome to Victorian serenity in this lovely suite. A wine colored floral carpet with pastel roses warms your feet. The walls and fabrics are light colors in shades of yellow, rose and green. There’s a bedroom and a separate sitting room with a two-sided fireplace that you can view from both rooms. The bed is a magnificent walnut 1880’s Eastlake Victorian with a matching marble top dresser. The large tile bathroom has glass French doors and hand painted walls.
