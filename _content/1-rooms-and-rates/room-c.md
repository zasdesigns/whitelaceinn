### Room C

##### Wild Roses:
This romantic setting has the feeling of an enchanted summer cottage with white wainscoted ceiling and walls. Above the wainscoting the white walls are hand-painted with rambling wild roses and the floor is covered with a patterned wool Ax Minster carpet from England. A wicker love seat and chair look inviting in front of the fireplace and the lovely 1895 canopy bed was handmade in the Amana colonies.
