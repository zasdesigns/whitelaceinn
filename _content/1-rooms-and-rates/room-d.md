### Room D

##### Country Cottage:
You will quickly feel at home in this charming room with its soft yellow, winding floral wallpaper on the ceiling and coordinating wallpaper on the walls. Another pastel floral fabric is splashed on the comfortable wicker chairs across from the fireplace. The bed is an ornately carved 1840â€™s four-poster. The bathroom has a pretty lavender Italian tile floor.
