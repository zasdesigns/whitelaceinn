Statamic Kindling Base Theme
================================

## Installing
1. Download the zip file (or clone via git) and unzip it or clone the repo into `/themes/`.
2. Name the folder whatever you want.
3. Rename the `/scss/kindling.scss`, `/css/kindling.css`, `/js/kindling.js` files to match the theme name.
4. Enjoy.

## Purpose

This theme is intended to be a base starting point for building your custom Statamic site or theme. There is *literally* no style or layout markup of any kind within.

## Theme Approach

Kindling has *more* going on than necessary. Remove anything you don't plan to use.
